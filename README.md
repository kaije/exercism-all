# Exercism - All Tracks

A place to keep my solutions as I work through various programming language tracks on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/).

I started using Exercism back in 2018, and only recently picked it up again after a lengthy break. They've recently released a shiny new third version, and _wow_ it looks amazing!

I've decided to use a single repo for all tracks this time around, so I've transferred my completed solutions across from the original repos:

- https://github.com/kaije/exercism-javascript
- https://github.com/kaije/exercism-java
- https://github.com/kaije/exercism-typescript
- https://github.com/kaije/exercism-python
