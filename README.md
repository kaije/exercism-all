# Exercism - All Tracks

A place to keep my solutions as I work through various programming language tracks on [Excercism](https://exercism.org/).

I started using Exercism back in 2018, and only recently picked it up again after a lengthy break. They've released a shiny new third version, and it looks pretty amazing!

This time around, I've decided to keep all the tracks in a single repo. I've transferred my completed solutions over, but have kept the original repos to preserve the timeline/history just for my own benefit:

- https://github.com/kaije/exercism-typescript
